Fig. 1. Fig. 1. The architecture of Min-Max Similarity. 〖{F〗_1,F_2}, 〖{C〗_1,C_2} and 〖{P〗_1,P_2} denote segmentation networks, classifiers and projectors, respectively. Here, classifiers extract features to build all-negative pairs, and projectors project unlabeled predictions to high dimension features for pixel-wise consistency measurement.
